# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and encourage the responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities you may find. If you discover a security issue, please report it by sending an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com).

Please include the following details in your report:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Impact assessment
- Affected versions
- Any supporting files or proof of concept

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours, and I will work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. We will keep you updated on the progress of the resolution.

### Security Update Timeline:
- Acknowledge receipt of your report: Within 48 hours
- Initial response and potential patch release: Within 5 business days
- Full resolution and public disclosure: After a fix is available

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates only for the following versions of this project. Please ensure that you are using a supported version to receive the latest security patches.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |

## Security Features

This project implements several security features to protect both users and contributors:
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data is transmitted over secure connections using HTTPS.
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated both client-side and server-side to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection.
- **Authentication**: If applicable, secure authentication mechanisms such as OAuth or JWT are used to protect user sessions.
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages are not exposed to the end user in production. Instead, errors are logged internally and handled safely.
- **Rate Limiting**: Form submissions and API requests are rate-limited to prevent abuse or brute-force attacks.

## Disclosure Policy

- **Security updates** will be made available only after a fix has been developed and tested.
- We aim to disclose security vulnerabilities publicly once a patch is released to allow users time to update their systems.
- **Public disclosures** will include minimal technical details to avoid exposing any unpatched vulnerabilities.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the security community for helping us maintain the integrity and security of this project. We follow the security best practices outlined by the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project).
